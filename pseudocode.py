# variable1 = print(1)
# execute variable1

# print 2+3
# can't excecute as is with variables because not global(?), unless all on the same line
# fixed by moving avriable defintions before exec as is, but cannot execute complex (combined) statements
# so order = replace nouns, execute as is, run as verb definition. Which means
# a1 = 2; print a1
a1 = 2 
print a1
execute print a1

# print 'hello'
# write 'hello'
# write hello
# speak 'hello'

say 'hello'
# tts is False
# sayiftts 'hello 1'
# tts is True
# sayiftts 'hello 2'

# something1 = 'hello'
# print something1
# say something1

# a = 2
# write a
# b = 2+3
# write b


# to scrawl something, write something
# scrawl 'hey'

# to exit, execute sys.exit() # bad keyword, returns exit instructions. same with quit, help

to end, execute sys.exit() 
# end

#save

# another = 'hey'
# something1 = print(another)
# execute something1

# to search something, google something, say result
# search cheese
# to google something, url is "www.google.com", open url..





# add 2 and 5

# shout 'hello'


# write 'hello' into file
# write 'hello' in file named test.txt
